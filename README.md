# `skelly`

A minimal skeleton for a proper Scala+ScalaJS build including unit tests, API docs, and tutorial documentation.

The code library is "Hello, World" level:  the whole point of this project is the build system.

See documentation on the (automatically built!) web site at <http://neelsmith.github.io/skelly>.
